description: "<p>Designed and developed a single page application, that blends SoundCloud and Rdio's API's into one seamless music
database and player. Used Angular, Susy, SASS, and HTML to create the user interface while keeping the core music player functions
in Object-Oriented JavaScript. The app is designed and built mobile first and is fully responsive.</p>
<p>Built with Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, AngularJS, Rdio, and SoundCloud.</p>
<p><strike>View live at rcloud.io</strike></p>
<p>*Unfortunately as of 12/22/2015 Rdio has closed it's doors, which has effectively shut down Rcloud. The code can still be viewed at <a href='https://github.com/neilspurgeon/rcloud'>github.com/neilspurgeon/rcloud</a> and an unfunctional site reamins at <a href='http://rcloud.io/'>rcloud.io</a></p>"
