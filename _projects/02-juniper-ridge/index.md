description: "<p>Wild harvested on the trail, Juniper Ridge creates perfumes and fragrances by distilling and extracting natural scents from wildflowers, plants, and tree trimmings. With such unique process, Juniper Ridge felt their current brand didnâ€™t represent them well enough. While our team worked on the full rebrand, I was heavily involved with the redesign of their fragrance packaging.</p>"
