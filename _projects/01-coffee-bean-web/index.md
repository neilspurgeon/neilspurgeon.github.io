description: "<p>Founded in 1963, The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf now serves over 1,000 locations around the world. Wanting their e-commerce experience to match that of their storeâ€™s, The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf came to Hathway for a solution. We fully redesigned both their marketing and e-commerce experience to better match their brand and to provide much more robust and simple to use shopping experience.</p>"
